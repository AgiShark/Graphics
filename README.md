# Graphics
Graphics settings plugin for AIGirl and HoneySelect2

Inspired and heavily influenced by PHIBL.

Please refer to unity's [post processing stack manual](https://docs.unity3d.com/2018.2/Documentation/Manual/PostProcessingOverview.html) for detailed description of the settings. [日本語](https://docs.unity3d.com/ja/2018.2/Manual/PostProcessingOverview.html)

Similar to PHIBL, AIGraphics uses cubemaps for imaged based lighting (IBL). Some sample cubemaps available [here](https://mega.nz/#F!PEMRkASB!I0ZTv4OgV-mSxX07MWDMQw). Put them in a folder named "cubemaps" at the root of the installation folder. You can configure the path for them with [Configuration Manager](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager).

Not compatible with DHH, the plugin won't load if you have DHH installed.
